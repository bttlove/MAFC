2025-07-10 14:09:42.772 +07:00 [WRN] Server digi-tbhh2:21044:07970cf4 stopped non-gracefully due to SqlServerHeartbeatProcess, ExpirationManager, Worker, DelayedJobScheduler, RecurringJobScheduler. Outstanding work on those dispatchers could be aborted, and there can be delays in background processing. This server instance will be incorrectly shown as active for a while. To avoid non-graceful shutdowns, investigate what prevents from stopping gracefully and add CancellationToken support for those methods.

2025-07-10 14:25:05.781 +07:00 [WRN] Server digi-tbhh2:1232:294b3172 stopped non-gracefully due to SqlServerHeartbeatProcess, ExpirationManager, CountersAggregator, Worker, DelayedJobScheduler. Outstanding work on those dispatchers could be aborted, and there can be delays in background processing. This server instance will be incorrectly shown as active for a while. To avoid non-graceful shutdowns, investigate what prevents from stopping gracefully and add CancellationToken support for those methods.
